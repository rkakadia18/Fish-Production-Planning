# Fish-Production-Planning
Optimization model using Excel Solver for production planning in supply chain industries
Developed a linear programming model to help Salmones Puyuhuapi maximize profits while processing 42,000 fish across five product types under tight machine, labor, and storage constraints. The model provided a data-driven production plan and evaluated the financial impact of adding freezer space.
